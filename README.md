## Implementation

### Commands and Expressions
 In this project, the general-purpose Oberon language was implemented using Scala. First, there were implemented the expressions and commands, such as: assignments, declarations of variables, loops, condicionals, multiplication, arithmetic expressions and some expressions to compare values. The only types defined were Integer and Boolean values, to make the implementation easier.

### Functions and Procedures
 Oberon is a language that was first conceived to increase the power of Modula-2, the direct successor of Pascal, while reducing it's complexity. Saying that, the calling of functions and procedures is similar to Pascal, with the same structures. A procedure is a function that returns an undefined value, and a function has a value returned. It's important to know that neither of those are commands or expressions, but their calling is as expression. 

### Tests
 The library used to test the implementation of the Oberon0 language was ScalaTest. The tests are in /src/test.
